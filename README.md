Our project is the analysis and evaluation of translation services using the mapreduce framework. 

Translation services assist the users of different language origin to interact with each other without being bounded by the language constraints. Since Big data is a recent upcoming technology in the market, it becomes very difficult to perform effective analysis using the existing traditional techniques. That is why, we used the MapReduce, which is comparatively a lightweight framework, to translate the massive data. We want to compare and learn the issues such as latency, geographical location, and accuracy of the different translation APIs while translating the large size of data.
Our proposed solution is described below which uses the AWS EC2 services to evaluate the translation services across geographically separated locations. 

From the evaluation results, after comparing two translation services with:
Various file sizes
Varying the number of Mappers
Three different languages, and
Two different locations (US-Oregon, Asia-Mumbai)

We deduce that the Google translate API outperforms the Bing Translate API.
